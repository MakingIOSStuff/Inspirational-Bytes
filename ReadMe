# What is Inspirational_Bytes?
Inspirational_Bytes is an app that will allow you (the user) to receive your
daily dose of inspiration. The app is simple to use and will offer a quick
way to find inspiration from many sources via an easy to use interface that
is intuitive and appealing.

# Using the app
** QOTD
Using the application is meant to be simple and intuitive. The primary use
of the app is to get the Quote Of The Day, which is displayed by simply opening
the application.

** Random Quotes
If you require extra inspiration you are able to push the "Get Random Quotes"
button. This button will take you to a second view which will display random
quotes that have been stored for you. If the provided quote is still not enough
you are able to cycle through the random quotes using the "Give Me Another"
button.

** Sharing Quotes
If you are truly inspired by a quote that you have found you can share the
quote with others by using the share button in the top right corner of the
screen. The same function is available on the QOTD view.

** Saving Quotes
If you want to save a quote to your quote library you can do so by tapping the
star icon. The quote will be saved to your device and be viewable in your
personal quote library from the home screen. The same function is available
on the QOTD view.

** Viewing Saved Quotes
If you would like to view your saved quotes you can do so by tapping the
book icon on the bottom bar of the home screen. This will display a list view
that you can move through to find the quote you are interested in viewing.
Tapping on the quote will display the entire quote on a large view and make the
view sharable.

** Deleting Saved Quotes
If you decide that you no longer want a saved quote in your library you can
remove the quote by simply swiping the quote to the left in the list view.
This will delete the quote from your library and updates immediately. This
function cannot be undone.
